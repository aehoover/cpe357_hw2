The guess program is a simple guessing game. The program will ask you questions
about an animal you are thinking of. Answer yes and no to the questions. If the 
program fails to guess your animal it will prompt you to enter in your animal
and a new question that will allow the program to guess correctly. Upon the next
run of the program, it should be able to guess your animal.

From the Linux command line navigate into the project directory.
Use command make all to build the project.
To run the project type ./guess
